# stream-deck-ui
A GUI client of stream deck (for linux)

This is a GUI client for elgato stream deck for linux. I created this for my personal use. Thought I would share it. The app currently supports only basic features like changing the button background, rearraning them and assigning a command to each.

## Usage
```git clone https://github.com/v4run/stream-deck-ui.git```

```yarn install && yarn start```
